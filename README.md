# Cloned after losing my application
I cloned this website after working through the tutorial to Module 7. My laptop was having an issue and we thought it might help to delete my profile. 
In the future I will use github.com to protect my tutorial and learning progress. To get started with a new repository follow the cheatsheet provided by [Nathaniel Avery at www.notyourdadsit.com](http://www.notyourdadsit.com/blog/2018/4/3/cheatsheet-setup-github-on-visual-studio-code)

> **Note** The [auth branch](/../../tree/auth) in this repository implements an *unsupported* and *undocumented* version of the library with User Authentication and Authorization. This may be a useful starting point for some users.
